# Brainnest Front-End Training Week 2 CSS Assignment

This project is the Week 2 Assignment of the Brainnest Front-End Training. I've created a front-end website for a fictional food delivery service named 5Kütchen (meaning *five cuisines* in German). 

The idea is that 5Kütchen is a food delivery website + mobile app for Berlin (Germany) and it's fully dedicated to five international cuisines: Italian, Brazilian, Greek, Turkish and Indian. That is, 5Kütchen delivers food from Berlin restaurants that serve dishes from one or more of those cuisines.
